    <h1>Kata: How many lightsabers do you own?</h1>
    <h2>Open the console...</h2>
    <p>
      Inspired by the development team at Vooza, write the function that accepts
      the name of a programmer, and returns the number of lightsabers owned by
      that person. The only person who owns lightsabers is Zach, by the way. He
      owns 18, which is an awesome number of lightsabers. Anyone else owns 0.
      Note: your function should have a default parameter. For example(Input -->
      Output): "anyone else" --> 0 "Zach" --> 18
